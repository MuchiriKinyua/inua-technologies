## 1. Problem Statement
Despite advancements in technology, a significant portion of the disabled community still faces barriers to accessing and utilizing IT technology effectively. This lack of accessibility limits their opportunities for education, employment, social interaction, and overall independence. Many existing IT solutions are not designed with the diverse needs of disabled individuals in mind, leading to exclusion and marginalization. Inua Technologies recognizes the urgent need to bridge this gap and create inclusive IT solutions that empower the disabled community to fully participate in society and lead fulfilling lives. Through innovative approaches and collaboration, we aim to address the challenges faced by disabled individuals and foster a more inclusive and equitable digital environment.
